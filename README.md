# habitica_calendar
> Habitica calendar allows you to add tasks easily in habitica, ordered chronologically, based on your google calendar for that day.

This is to be integrated with prodactive, but also works perfectly fine on its own.

Plans:
----
* Integrate with prodactive
* Add functionality to delete old tasks
* Expand outwards to other forms of to do lists?
